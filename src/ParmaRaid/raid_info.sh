    It's easy to look up what RAIDs are and do, so this is not meant to be exhaustive,
    but rather, some extra information that might not be obvious.

    Not only is a RAID mounted, but there is also a RAID process (program) that needs 
    to be running. This is why there is are 'stop' and 'assemble' options available 
    in the menu.
    
    You can't just mount the RAID drives without having the RAID process running. 
          
    You also can't stop the process unless you unmount the drives.

    The drives are formatted, but also there is another layer of format that happens 
    at a higher level, across all the drives.
