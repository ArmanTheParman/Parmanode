hidden services are at /var/lib/tor
tor for mac is installed with homebrew
From version 3.29.0, I will start moving services and new services to $dp/
electrs docker container has a separate tor instance at port 9060. I don't think I'll 
continue doing it that way for other programs. This methode ensure tor is running and
removes the need for tor system configuration
