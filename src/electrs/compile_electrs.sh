    Compiling electrs seems to have failed.$orange This can happen as there is much 
    variability between systems and not everthing can be anticipated.

    You have options...
$cyan
        1)$orange Uninstall this partial installation yourself from the remove menu, 
           and try again (sometimes works)
$cyan
        2)$orange Uninstall this partial installation yourself, and install the Docker
           version of electrs instead. Docker is a container with an operating system
           which which is identical between systems, reduces chances of installation
           failure.
$cyan    
        3)$orange Install Fulcrum or Electrum X instead of electrs
$cyan
        4)$orange Put computer in the bin (I've been tempted).
$green
    Regardless of which option you choose, you should get more bitcoin.
