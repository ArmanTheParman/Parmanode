                             Parman's Electrum Guide
$orange
    This is a massive Guide I put together about Electrum, approximately 10,000 words
    with screenshot demonstrations. It is based on  version 4.4.4 but most of it
    will apply to newer version with some slight modifications.

    The guide can be found at:

    Some of the instructions are already taken care of for you if you install and
    use Electrum with Parmanode. But it is still useful to learn it and become 
    more independent with your software usage.
