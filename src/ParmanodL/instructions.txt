TEMPLATE FOR PARMANODL

Thank you for buying/using Parmanode.

To run Parmanode, you can type 'rp' in the Terminal then <enter>. 
Terminal is run by clicking that black icon on the taskbar.

On Pi's, the Terminal doesn't automatically resize, so please widen the 
screen and make it taller using the mouse so the text doesn't wrap 
around and look ugly.

Read everything presented to you on the screen, take your time, and
it'll be easy.

Bitcoin should be running in the background automatically when you turn
on the Pi. Give it an hour or so to catch up with the rest of the
network, as it was offline while being shipped.

Sometimes, you'll get a 'not mounted' error when starting Bitcoin.
Make sure the drive is connected and you see its icon on the desktop.
If not, unplug and replug it in. It should mount.

The password for the computer is "parmanode". Please change it with the
command "passwd parman" (use the Terminal).

To access Parmanode from another computer on the network, type:

ssh parman@parmanodl.local

then this computer's password.  Notice, it is parmanodl.local, NOT 
parmanode.local.

If that doesn't work, you'll need the computer's IP address, which can
be a bit tricky to find. One way is to look it up on your router's
page, then do the command like this (example number shown):

ssh parman@192.168.0.100

You can use Parmanode to install various wallets - Sparrow or Electrum,
or Specter are the recommended ones. There others are for hardware
wallets, included to help you migrate yourself away from them (not
necessary but recommended).

Enjoy.
