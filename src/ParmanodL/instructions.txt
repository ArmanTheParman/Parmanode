TEMPLATE FOR PARMANODL
NEED TO FILL IN 2 PASSWORDS



Thank you for using Parmanode.

Bitcoin will be running in the background automatically when you turn
on the Pi. Give it an hour or so to catch up with the rest of the
network, as it was offline while being shipped.

To run Parmanode, you can type 'rp' in the Terminal then <enter>. 
Terminal is run by clicking that black icon at the top.

On Pi's, the Terminal doesn't automatically resize, so please widen the 
screen and make it taller using the mouse so the text doesn't wrap 
around and look ugly.

The password for the computer is "       ". Please change it with the
command "passwd parman" (use the Terminal).

Alternatively, you can double click the run_parmanode.sh icon I left on
the desktop. You'll get a pop-up; choose "execute in terminal".

To access Parmanode from another computer on the network, type:

ssh parman@parmanodl.local
then this computer's password.

Notice, it is parmanodl.local, NOT parmanode.local.

INFO ONLY: The Bitcoin username is "parman", and the password is
"     ". You could change it but there is no need; you don't even need
to particularly remember it. This is different to the computer's
password. 

This Bitcoin password is used by Bitcoin Core to authenticate connections 
by other software to it. It is accessible to view or change (not 
recommended) via the bitcoin.conf file (not recommended), or by the 
Parmanode-Use-Bitcoin menu.

You can use Parmanode to install various wallets - Sparrow or Electrum,
or Specter are the recommended ones. There others are for hardware
wallets, included to help you migrate yourself away from them (not
necessary but recommended).

Enjoy.
