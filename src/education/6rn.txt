                             Six reasons to run a node.


Let me explain quickly that a Bitcoin node is any computer which runs a piece of 
software (Bitcoin Core) that has some important jobs:

Your Bitcoin node needs to keep a copy of the entire Bitcoin blockchain. It has to 
connect with other nodes, forming a network of communication, which propagates 
transactions (transactions are kept in a “mempool”, i.e., the queue of transactions 
waiting to be included in the next block, and thus added to the blockchain). It needs 
to check that all additions to the blockchain are valid, and reject those that are not 
valid. It will provide details about the blockchain — such as balances — to other 
types of software that ask, like wallets. And it will provide a copy of the blockchain 
to any new node that wants to join. The new node then independently checks that every 
transaction in the copy it receives is valid. It does not actually “trust” the 
connected node.

To run a node, you download Bitcoin Core software, and then let it copy the blockchain 
from other nodes, and your node verifies each block itself. You then leave it on, 
and new blocks are received roughly every 10 minutes (the blocks contain transactions 
taken from the mempool). Your node will check if the block is valid, and if so, add it 
to its copy of the blockchain.

A dodgy block gets rejected, not because everyone else rejects it, and not because 
everyone copies their neighbor, but because the block is invalid according to the 
rules contained in the Bitcoin Core software, and everyone else that is running the 
same software will also reject that dodgy block.

Your Bitcoin wallet does not keep a copy of the blockchain, and is usually separate 
from Bitcoin Core (although Bitcoin Core does have a wallet feature). Your wallet just 
holds your keys. It has to ask a Bitcoin node, “Hey Mr. Node, this address of mine, 
does it have any bitcoin in it?” Technically that’s not quite accurate, but this is 
sufficient for now.

Running your own node means you don’t ask other people what their copy of Bitcoin Core 
is doing. It’s your own copy of Bitcoin Core, and you don’t need to trust other people. 
Your wallet can ask YOUR copy of the Bitcoin blockchain (making the digital connection 
between your wallet and node is the technically challenging and critical part, not 
just running the node — an article for another day).

So with the preamble done, let me next explain why it is important to run your own 
node:


REASON 1

Privacy. When your wallet tells you your bitcoin balance, it asks a RANDOM public 
Bitcoin node what balance each of your addresses contains. It then gives you the 
results, and you see your total bitcoin in that wallet. Even empty addresses which you 
haven’t used get queried. Surveillance companies run some of these nodes. “What the 
Hell?” Yes, it’s true.

You are telling a random entity, possibly a surveillance company, your IP address 
(which can be used to identify you), and that you have a Bitcoin wallet, and ALL of 
your current and future addresses you'll use within that wallet, and all the balances 
of all those addresses, now and later. Providing this information to surveillance 
companies is dangerous for many reasons. For example, this data can be leaked 
intentionally — to the government when requested — or unintentionally (to hackers). 
Governments may target Bitcoiners with heavy wealth taxes or confiscation, as the US 
government once did for gold with order 6102 in 1933, and hackers may target you to 
extort or trick you out of your bitcoin.


REASON 2

You can confirm for yourself trustlessly that you are receiving real bitcoin. For 
example, when you sell something, a technically sophisticated buyer could potentially 
manipulate which node your wallet connects to. They could send you counterfeit bitcoin, 
and your wallet would think it’s received real bitcoin because the malicious node lied 
to your wallet. Granted, this is very unlikely, but the fact that you can prevent it by 
running a node makes the development of this kind of attack not interesting or fruitful. 
What actually happens with this attack? The scammer somehow gets your Bitcoin wallet to 
read the wrong blockchain from a malicious node. He moves supposed bitcoin on THAT 
blockchain, not the real one, and your wallet thinks you’ve been paid.

If you get scammed in this way, you may accept this counterfeit as final payment, and 
may send goods in exchange for the fake bitcoin. One day, when you connect to a genuine 
Bitcoin node, your wallet will show that you never in fact received bitcoin. Your 
balance will be lower than what you thought it should be, because the fake transfer 
never existed on the real Bitcoin blockchain.

You can prevent this by connecting your wallet to a node you trust, but even better is 
to connect to your own node. “Don’t trust, verify,” is the Bitcoiner’s mantra.

Not doing this is kind of like accepting gold as payment, and asking a random person 
to use their XRF analyser to check if the gold you received is real. You don’t know if 
that random person is on the side of the buyer, or if they are honest.

You might ask, “No trust? Wait, aren’t I trusting Bitcoin Core when I download it? How 
do I know THAT’s not fake?” Yes and no. There are ways to verify that the software you 
downloaded is genuine, but that’s not for this article.

You might then ask, “Aren’t I trusting the developers that the genuine copy is behaving 
as I expect?” Actually yes, unless you write the software yourself, or read the code, 
or pay someone to read the code — but then you are trusting them. There has to be some 
level of trust, but the idea is to keep it to a minimum. (Just saying that might get me 
in trouble with the Bitcoin mob, shhh!) Most people (me included), can’t and won't read 
the code, so there is some element of trust. The trust is that hundreds, maybe 
thousands, of developers’ eyes are going over the code looking for errors and problems 
before it is released. It’s not easy to make changes to Bitcoin Core, and this is a 
feature, not a bug.  Using the gold XRF analyser analogy, you are probably not going to 
build one from scratch to check whether or not your gold is real, and that’s okay.


REASON 3

Defend the Bitcoin rules from unwanted changes — like scarcity or block size.

If a group of "powerful" people banded together, as they did in 2017, and decided to 
try to change the rules of how Bitcoin works (for example, by increasing the block 
size), you can choose to not upgrade your node to the new system and keep your current 
node. If you are more than the minority, there will be a pool of people running the 
unchanged Bitcoin Core and a pool of people running the changed version — a fork. This 
is how Bitcoin Cash was born. The new version was unanimously rejected, but those who 
lost the war kept running their nodes and mining bitcoin cash as well. Those who owned 
bitcoin then also owned bitcoin cash. For a given address, there was one balance on the 
Bitcoin blockchain, one balance on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

If you weren’t running your own node at the time, you had no say in this war. Your 
wallet might have connected to a Bitcoin Cash node and someone might have paid you in 
bitcoin cash instead of with bitcoin. You then might have given up your goods in 
exchange for coins that didn’t meet the monetary policy you preferred.


REASON 4

If you run a node, and leave it on 24 hours a day, this helps the network.

The more nodes that are running, the faster transactions can propagate for everyone, 
and the harder it is to shut down Bitcoin. In order to kill Bitcoin, every single 
copy of the blockchain must be destroyed.


REASON 5

Be an "Uncle Jim".

In the future, it may be too challenging for EVERYONE to run their own node, but we 
don’t want people trusting random nodes. I imagine there will be a technical person in 
every social “circle of trust” ("Uncle Jim") for people to connect their wallets to. 
This tiny trade-off is far better than connecting to random public Bitcoin nodes.

If you learn to run your own node, then YOU also become a kind of human node, because 
you could one day help someone else to run and use their own node.


REASON 6

Coolness factor and street cred.

Running your own node is super cool, and gives you a great appreciation of the power 
of Bitcoin. You’ll probably end up buying more.
