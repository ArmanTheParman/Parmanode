    Need help with Bitcoin security, self-custody, and inheritance?

    Bitcoin self-sovereignty, while maintaining high security, safety, and privacy. 
    
    Few people will take the time to build their technical skills. It can be daunting.
    It is crucial to get your coins off the exchange (safely!), as the bare minimum, 
    but progressing beyond that is also important.

    This is a one-to-one mentorship course (not a group/class), at your own pace, 
    involving multiple video call meetings - it could take weeks, or if you want to 
    take your time, months.

    The program includes …

            Bitcoin knowledge (understanding private keys, blockchain, mining etc)
            Running a node
            Using a hardware wallet
            Verifying Bitcoin software using gpg (public/private key cryptography 
                    verification and hashes)
            Making a watching-only wallet
            Making an air-gapped computer
            Safe key generation
            Safe key storage
            Multisignature wallet generation
            How to hide your coins on the blockchain
            How to remove KYC tainting of coins
            UTXO management
            Using the Lightning Network
            Inheritance planning

Hi ZZZZ,

Thank you for your email. A few months ago I completed my mentorship with Parman. 
I already had a relatively high level of knowledge both in theory and in practice, 
but I had reached the maximum I could learn by myself and I realised that I needed a 
more complete, structural approach with particular focus on privacy and security.

Parman’s site was by far the best one I ever found, therefore I did not hesitate 
one moment to apply for a mentorship. It turned out to be the money best spent in 
years. Thanks to Parman I learned everything I needed to and more. Parman is an 
absolutely great teacher (being myself a university professor, I know something 
about it): he’s patient, focused on the essential, he manages to make complicated 
things very simple. In addition, he’s an extremely kind person. His in-depth 
technical knowledge about Bitcoin and his privacy/security standards in how to use 
Bitcoin are, I believe, the maximum that you can get on the market. Therefore, my 
answer to your first question is that I was extremely happy with his services.

The Zoom sessions worked great for me because they were flexible (which was exactly 
what I needed): they lasted the time needed for the topic discussed (no more and 
no less); we fixed the appointments when we were both available. Without this 
flexibility I probably would not have managed to complete the mentorship and 
certainly I would have enjoyed it much less. The membership process lasted 
approximately two months, give or take (more intense at the beginning, spontaneously 
less intense towards the end)…. My level of privacy and security (and therefore my 
confidence) in my use of Bitcoin increased enormously after this mentorship: even 
more than I expected. I warmly recommend him.

Kind regards,

YYYY

Subject: Reference for Parman (BTC Mentorship Program)

Hi ZZZZ,

Glad to answer your questions regarding our experience with Parman. We had a unique 
situation that Parman helped navigate us through. He was very patient and kind as he 
helped us secure our bitcoin and he gave us sound advice on how to proceed with our 
situation. The Zoom sessions were easy, no problems. I can’t really answer your 
questions on how long the mentorship program took as our situation was unique, 
although we are going to send our son through his mentorship program this summer. 
Parman was very careful with our private information, often reminding us not to 
reveal too much.

All that being said, I can wholeheartedly recommend Parman’s mentorship program. 
He is a rare man of intellect and integrity. He is also very patient and 
understanding. We had a great experience and learned quite a bit.

Hope this helps, if I can answer any more questions, let me know.

Kind regards,

WWWW
