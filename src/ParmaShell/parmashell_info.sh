    Here's some cool things you can do in terminal when ParmaShell is installed.

    - Keyboard shortcuts have been created with speed in mind. Start using them and
      soon you'll get faster.
    - The default size of the screen is a bit bigger (programmable)
    - The refreshed state will show the contents of the directory in colour, and the
      current working directory printed in full.
    - Refresh anytime with \"a\"
    - If its too cluttered with a refresh, just type \"st\" and the screen will be
      refreshed without the directory contents. It alse adjusts the screen size.
    - \"aa\" with print out \"ls -lah\" with a refreshed screen and contents printed
      at the top
    - \"..\" you'll already use but it will now refresh the screen and print the
      directory contents.
    - \"d\" changes directory to Desktop, and refreshes
    - \"dl\" changes to Downloads directory, and refrehes
    - \"pn\" changes to the parmanode script driectory
    - \"pp\" changes to parman_programs directory
    - \"hp\" stands for 'home parmanode' and changes to the parmanode apps directory

   This list will grow as I think of good ideas.
   Requests welcom.
