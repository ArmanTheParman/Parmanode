Forward ports with a reverse SSH tunnel
Advantages

    no port forwarding needed on the LAN of the host
    encrypted connection
    hides the IP of the host

Requirements

    a Virtual Private Server (VPS) - eg. a minimal package on Lunanode for ~3.5$/month
    root access on the VPS - only root can forward ports under no. 1000
    ssh access to the host computer (where the ports will be forwarded from)

Setup
On the host (your BTCPay Server instance)

Check for an ssh public key:

cat ~/.ssh/*.pub

 

 
        Copied!
    

If there is none generate one (keep pressing ENTER):

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

 

 
        Copied!
    

This will generate the SSH keypair id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub inside ~/.ssh.

The private key needs to get added to the ssh-agent:

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

# add private key to ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

 

 
        Copied!
    

Copy the public key over to the VPS (fill in the VPS_IP_ADDRESS). You will be prompted for the root password of the VPS.

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS

 

 
        Copied!
    

To verify that it works, SSH into the VPS – this should not prompt for the password anymore:

ssh root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS

 

 
        Copied!
    

On the VPS

You can either reuse the connection from before or login as root.

Edit the sshd config:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

 

 
        Copied!
    

Make sure these entries are active (meaning there is no # at the beggining of the line). Alternatively, you can just paste these on the end of the file:

RSAAuthentication yes     # not needed on latest OpenSSH versions
PubkeyAuthentication yes
GatewayPorts yes
AllowTcpForwarding yes
ClientAliveInterval 60

 

 
        Copied!
    

CTRL+O, ENTER to save, CTRL+X to exit.

WARNING

You can lose access at this point if the sshd config is wrong. Please double-check!

Restart the sshd service:

sudo systemctl restart sshd

 

 
        Copied!
    

Back to the host (your BTCPay Server instance)
Install and set up autossh

Install the autossh dependency:

sudo apt-get install autossh

 

 
        Copied!
    

Create the service file:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/autossh-tunnel.service

 

 
        Copied!
    

Paste the following and fill in the VPS_IP_ADDRESS. Add or remove ports as required.

[Unit]
Description=AutoSSH tunnel service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=root
Group=root
Environment="AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -C -M 0 -v -N -o "ServerAliveInterval=60" -R 9735:localhost:9735 -R 443:localhost:443 -R 80:localhost:80 root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS
StandardOutput=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

 

 
        Copied!
    

Enable and start the service:

sudo systemctl enable autossh-tunnel
sudo systemctl start autossh-tunnel

 

 
        Copied!
    

The port forwarding with a reverse ssh-tunnel is now complete. You should be able access the ports/services of the host computer through the IP of the VPS.
Monitoring

Check if there are any errors on the host computer:

sudo journalctl -f -n 20 -u autossh-tunnel

 

 
        Copied!
    

To check if tunnel is active on the VPS:

netstat -tulpn

 

 
        Copied!
