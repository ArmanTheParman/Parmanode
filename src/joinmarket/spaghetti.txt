Joinmarket needs to make a bitcoin wallet.
    - Mac Bitcoin installation doesn't always have bitcoin-cli, necessary to make wallets
      with a script.
    - To work around this, bitcoin-cli can be installed inside a Docker container.
    - It can't be installed in the Joinmarket container with docker exec because
      the container needs to be running to do that. But the container can't run
      unless joinmarket is installed, but the installation of joinmarket needs bitcoin-cli.
    - The circular problem can be solved in two ways.
      1) Put bitcoin-cli in ParmaBox, and use docker exec with that container 
         instead of the joinmarket container - this has the advantage of the
         creation of generic code that installs bitcoin into any container, so
         I went with this option.
      2) Install Bitcoin-cli using Joinmarket's dockerfile. The Linux version will
         not require it, so I favoured the other method.
    - I'm not sure yet if bitcoin-cli is going to be needed again. If it is, it might
      be a problem if the user changes the user/password in bitcoin.conf, becuase it
      needs to match the bitcoin.conf credentials that exists in the docker container.

Joinmarket needs tor
    - Not a problem for linux because docker linux can use the host network
    - For mac, it cannot use the host network, and mapping port 9050 causes a confict,
      so the mac docker conainer of joinmarket will have its own tor installation.
