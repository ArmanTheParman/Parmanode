    Electrum X is a type of Electrum server designed to interface with a Bitcoin node 
    (ideally your own!). It processes data from the node to build its own optimized 
    database, reorganizing blockchain information to enable faster, more efficient 
    communication with wallets like Electrum.

    A key advantage of using your own Electrum server over querying a Bitcoin node 
    directly is enhanced privacy. Electrum servers handle wallet data more securelyâ€”
    for example, encrypting interactions that might otherwise be in plaintext. While 
    the technical specifics are beyond this overview, this privacy layer is a benefit.  

    The primary reason to run an Electrum server is performance. Electrum X streamlines 
    wallet synchronization and queries, offering a smoother experience. While only one 
    server is needed, maintaining backups can prevent downtime if database corruption 
    occurs, though rare.  

    Among Electrum servers, Electrum X is the most robust and widely adopted, powering 
    nearly all public servers. Its maturity and scalability make it the default choice 
    for reliability and compatibility.
